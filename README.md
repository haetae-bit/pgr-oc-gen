# Punishing Gray Raven: Original Character Generator
## ... Or PGR: OC Gen for short
### AKA PGROCG

This is a silly one-off project meant to help and inspire fans create their own commandant for the cross-platform, action role-playing game called [Punishing: Gray Raven](https://pgr.kurogame.net/) by KuroGame.

TODO:
- [ ] Get a list of traits
- [ ] Look up how generators work
- [ ] Have some nice styles
- [ ] Deploy

Nice to haves:
- [ ] Have an option to create Constructs
- [ ] Frame ideas or motifs
- [ ] Name/title generator?
